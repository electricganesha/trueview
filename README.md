# True View
## Concept
True View is a 3D space visualizer, that allows for the user to contemplate a certain space with a birdâ€™s eye view while interacting with it. This product is extremely useful for visualization of festivals, fairs, indoors and outdoors environments and much more. True View can adapt to your needs, in terms of environment and interaction, with a wide range of different information to be displayed, in many possible formats - imagine an outdoors summer music festival, viewed from above, where you could click on each of the festival areas/grounds and obtain specific information about them, like the prices of merchandise, or the line-up for a certain stage. Those are the capabilities of True View. In this particular example, we can see a representation of a Playstation festival stand, with a particular interaction displaying text about a certain element of the festival. This project is developed in WebGL, which is browser compatible, and allows for multi-platform compatibility.

## Tech
True View was developed in HTML/CSS/Javascript using the [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) framework.
